                <h2>About</h2>
             
              <p>
       FRASR is a multi layered artist who dabbles into the alternative Hip-Hop/RnB/Pop genre creating a wide range of sounds and textures ranging from angelic synths to high production heavy vocals that are built off of melody. 
       Coming from a background in music since a young child he has found a way to create a fusion sound that can be sonically pleasing to the ears of those that come across his art. 
        FRASR is known for Producing, Mixing, Mastering, Writing and Recording his own music after receiving a diploma in music production from Seneca College of Applied Arts and Technology. 
            He started his musical journey by releasing a EP in 2019 by the name of <i> Follow The Signs</i> which was some experimentation into fusion before moving into releasing songs bi-weekly in a number of different genres. 
            After gaining some notoriety for his frequent releases its was time to drop his next project release being 2021's <i>Eternyti</i>. This quickly became a significant impact on how he was to approach recording music in the future as the project was known to bend the laws of Pop/Rnb/Hip-Hop into a state of euphoric ecstasy. He has said it best by stating that hes is "Forever Under Seperate Eternyti".
